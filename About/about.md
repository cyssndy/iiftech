<h1>What is iif ??</h1><br>
<p>iif is a start-up electrical & computer technology company by 
	University of Waterloo ECE student Alfred in 2015, in his rented room
	without a chair.  <br>Where is
	the name 'iif' from? It's a function in Visual Basic which 
	crashed Alfred's program a lot when he was in his first coop term.</p>
